# savefig()
In matplotlib, savefig() is a function used to save the current figure as an image file. This function allows you to save the visualizations you have created using matplotlib in various image formats, such as PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, etc. It is particularly useful when you want to export your plots for use in reports, presentations, or publications.

The syntax for savefig() is as follows:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.savefig(filename, format='file_format')
```

Where:

<b>filename:</b> The name of the file you want to save. It should include the file extension appropriate for the desired image format.

<b>format:</b> The file format in which you want to save the image. This parameter is optional, and if not specified, matplotlib will try to infer the format from the file extension in the filename.

Here's an example of how to use savefig():

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple plot
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('Sample Plot')

# Save the plot as a PNG file
plt.savefig('sample_plot.png')

# Save the plot as a PDF file
plt.savefig('sample_plot.pdf')

# Save the plot as an SVG file
plt.savefig('sample_plot.svg')

plt.show()  # Display the plot on the screen
```

In this example, the plot is saved three times with different file formats: PNG, PDF, and SVG. The resulting files will be created in the same directory where your Python script or Jupyter Notebook is located.

Remember to call savefig() before calling plt.show(), as calling show() will clear the current figure and you won't be able to save it after that.

Additionally, you can provide various optional parameters to savefig() to customize the saved image, such as adjusting the resolution, setting the background color, or controlling the tight layout. Refer to the matplotlib documentation for more details on available options.
