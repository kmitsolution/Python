A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where individual values are represented as colors within a 2D matrix. Seaborn provides a convenient function to create heatmaps using the sns.heatmap() function. Heatmaps are particularly useful to visualize correlations in datasets or to display matrices in a more visually informative way.

To create a heatmap in Seaborn, you can follow these steps:

Import the necessary libraries.
1. Load your data (if not already loaded).
2. Create the heatmap using sns.heatmap().

Here's an example of creating a heatmap using the Seaborn library:

```python
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

arr_2d=np.linspace(1,5,12).reshape(4,3)
sns.heatmap(arr_2d)
plt.show()
```
