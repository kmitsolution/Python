# Scatter plot in Seaborn
To create a scatter plot using the "tips" dataset in Seaborn, you first need to load the dataset. Seaborn comes with some built-in datasets, and "tips" is one of them. It contains information about tips given to waiters based on various factors like total bill amount, tip amount, day of the week, etc.

Here's an example of how to create a scatter plot using the "tips" dataset in Seaborn:

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the "tips" dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')

# Create a scatter plot using Seaborn
sns.scatterplot(x='total_bill', y='tip', data=tips)

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('Total Bill')
plt.ylabel('Tip')
plt.title('Scatter Plot of Tips vs Total Bill')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

In this example, we use sns.scatterplot() to create a scatter plot. We specify the x-axis (x='total_bill') and the y-axis (y='tip') along with the data=tips parameter to indicate that we are using the "tips" dataset.

You can also customize the scatter plot by adding additional parameters to the sns.scatterplot() function, such as hue, size, and style, which allow you to add extra dimensions to the plot based on different variables. This can be useful for exploring additional patterns or correlations in the data.

For example, if you want to use the day column to add color to the scatter plot based on the day of the week, you can modify the sns.scatterplot() call like this:

```python
sns.scatterplot(x='total_bill', y='tip', hue='day', data=tips)
```

This will create a scatter plot where each data point is colored based on the day of the week it corresponds to. Seaborn automatically chooses a color palette for the different categories in the 'day' column.
