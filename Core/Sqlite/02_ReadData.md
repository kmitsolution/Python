## Read Data from Sqllite
To read data from an SQLite database in Python, you can use the SELECT statement with the help of the execute() method of the cursor object. The SELECT statement allows you to retrieve data from one or more tables in the database.

Assuming you have an existing SQLite database named "example.db" with a table named "users" that contains columns "id," "name," and "age," here's how you can read data from it:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database or create a new one if it doesn't exist
connection = sqlite3.connect("example.db")

# Create a cursor object
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Execute the SELECT query to retrieve data
select_query = "SELECT * FROM users;"
cursor.execute(select_query)

# Fetch all rows from the result set
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Process the retrieved data (e.g., print it)
for row in rows:
    user_id, name, age = row
    print(f"ID: {user_id}, Name: {name}, Age: {age}")

# Close the connection
connection.close()
```

In this example, we used the SELECT * FROM users; query to retrieve all rows from the "users" table. The fetchall() method of the cursor object retrieves all the rows returned by the query as a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a row in the result set, and we can access the individual columns using indexing (e.g., user_id, name, and age in this case).

You can customize the SELECT query to retrieve specific data or apply conditions using the WHERE clause. For example:

python
Copy code
# Retrieve users with age greater than 30
select_query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;"


Remember to modify the query based on your specific data retrieval requirements. Additionally, always ensure that the database connection is closed after you finish working with it.

sqlite3 module provides several fetch methods, such as fetchone(), fetchall(), and fetchmany(), to retrieve data from the result set after executing a query.

<b>fetchone():</b> This method fetches the next row of the result set and returns it as a single tuple or None if no more rows are available.

<b>fetchall():</b> This method fetches all the remaining rows of the result set and returns them as a list of tuples.

<b>fetchmany(size):</b> This method fetches the next set of rows specified by the size parameter and returns them as a list of tuples.

For example, if you have executed a query and want to retrieve data from the result set, you can use these methods:

```python

import sqlite3

# Connect to the database or create a new one if it doesn't exist
connection = sqlite3.connect("example.db")

# Create a cursor object
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Execute the SELECT query to retrieve data
select_query = "SELECT * FROM users;"
cursor.execute(select_query)

# Fetch one row from the result set
one_row = cursor.fetchone()
print(one_row)

# Fetch all rows from the result set
all_rows = cursor.fetchall()
print(all_rows)

# Fetch 5 rows from the result set
five_rows = cursor.fetchmany(5)
print(five_rows)

# Close the connection
connection.close()
```

Again, please note that as of my knowledge cutoff, the fetchany() method is not a part of the standard sqlite3 module in Python. If you came across this method in a library or a custom implementation, it might be specific to that library or implementation.
