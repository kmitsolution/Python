## Read Data from Sqllite
To read data from an SQLite database in Python, you can use the SELECT statement with the help of the execute() method of the cursor object. The SELECT statement allows you to retrieve data from one or more tables in the database.

Assuming you have an existing SQLite database named "example.db" with a table named "users" that contains columns "id," "name," and "age," here's how you can read data from it:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database or create a new one if it doesn't exist
connection = sqlite3.connect("example.db")

# Create a cursor object
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Execute the SELECT query to retrieve data
select_query = "SELECT * FROM users;"
cursor.execute(select_query)

# Fetch all rows from the result set
rows = cursor.fetchall()

# Process the retrieved data (e.g., print it)
for row in rows:
    user_id, name, age = row
    print(f"ID: {user_id}, Name: {name}, Age: {age}")

# Close the connection
connection.close()
```

In this example, we used the SELECT * FROM users; query to retrieve all rows from the "users" table. The fetchall() method of the cursor object retrieves all the rows returned by the query as a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a row in the result set, and we can access the individual columns using indexing (e.g., user_id, name, and age in this case).

You can customize the SELECT query to retrieve specific data or apply conditions using the WHERE clause. For example:

python
Copy code
# Retrieve users with age greater than 30
select_query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;"


Remember to modify the query based on your specific data retrieval requirements. Additionally, always ensure that the database connection is closed after you finish working with it.
