In Python, identifiers are names used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules, or other entities in the code. An identifier is a sequence of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, or underscores (_) that follows certain rules and conventions. Python has reserved words, also known as keywords, that have special meanings and purposes within the language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers. Here are some key points regarding identifiers and reserved words in Python:

## Identifiers:

1. Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
2. Can be followed by any combination of letters, digits, or underscores.
3. Are case-sensitive, meaning that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different.
4. Examples of valid identifiers: <b>my_variable, total_sum, _private_variable, PI.</b>

## Reserved Words (Keywords):

Python has a set of reserved words that are used to define the syntax and structure of the language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers because they have specific meanings and functions within Python. Here is a list of Python's reserved words as of Python 3.9:
```
False  await  else    import  pass
None   break  except  in      raise
True   class  finally is      return
and    continue    for     lambda  try
as     def     from    nonlocal    while
assert del     global  not     with
async  elif    if      or      yield
```
You should <b>avoid</b> using these reserved words as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers in your code.

It's important to note that although the reserved words cannot be used as identifiers, you can use variations of the reserved words by adding underscores or using mixed case to create unique and descriptive identifiers. For example, instead of using class as an identifier, you can use my_class or myClass.

By following the identifier naming rules and avoiding the use of reserved words, you can create meaningful and descriptive names for your variables, functions, and other entities in your Python code.
