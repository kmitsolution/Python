# Class Constructor
In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created. It is called automatically when an object is instantiated from a class. The constructor method is named __init__ (double underscores before and after "init") and is defined within the class. Here's how the constructor works in a class:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):
        self.attribute1 = arg1
        self.attribute2 = arg2
```

In this example, __init__ is the constructor method. It takes three parameters: self, arg1, and arg2. The self parameter represents the instance of the class being created (similar to this in other programming languages). The other two parameters arg1 and arg2 are used to pass values during object instantiation.

When you create an object of the class, Python automatically calls the __init__ method and passes the object itself (self) as the first argument. The other arguments are provided by the caller. For example:

```python
obj = MyClass("value1", "value2")
```

In the above code, the __init__ method is called with self as the first argument (representing obj), and "value1" and "value2" are passed as the second and third arguments, respectively. The constructor assigns these values to the attribute1 and attribute2 attributes of the object.

Now, you can access these attributes through the object:

```python
print(obj.attribute1)  # Output: "value1"
print(obj.attribute2)  # Output: "value2"
```

Constructors are commonly used to initialize the state of an object, setting default values for its attributes or performing any necessary setup tasks. They allow you to customize object creation based on the provided arguments, ensuring that objects are properly initialized when they are created.
