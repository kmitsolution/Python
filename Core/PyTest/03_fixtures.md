# fixtures in pytest
In pytest, a fixture is a powerful concept that provides a way to set up and tear down resources needed for testing. Fixtures are functions marked with the @pytest.fixture decorator. They can be used to create test data, initialize objects, open database connections, or perform any setup required for the test functions. Fixtures help in writing modular and reusable test code, as they allow you to separate the setup and teardown logic from the test functions. Here's how you can use fixtures in pytest:

### Defining a Fixture:
To create a fixture, you define a function with the @pytest.fixture decorator. The fixture function can yield values or return them using return. The test functions that need this fixture can declare it as an argument, and pytest will automatically call the fixture function and provide the result to the test function.
```python

@pytest.fixture
def setup():
    print("This will execute first")
    yield
    print("This will execute in the end")
def testlogin(setup):
    print("login is successful")
```

```python
import pytest

# Fixture that returns a list of test data
@pytest.fixture
def test_data():
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    return data
```
### Using a Fixture in Test Functions:
To use the fixture in test functions, you need to declare the fixture function name as an argument to the test function.
```python
def test_fixture_example(test_data):
    assert len(test_data) == 5
    assert sum(test_data) == 15
```
### Fixtures with Setup and Teardown:
You can use fixtures to set up and tear down resources before and after the test runs.
```python
import pytest

# Fixture with setup and teardown
@pytest.fixture
def database_connection():
    # Setup: Connect to the database
    db = connect_to_database()

    yield db

    # Teardown: Close the database connection
    db.close()
```
### Using Multiple Fixtures in a Test:
You can use multiple fixtures in a test function by declaring them as arguments to the test function.
```python

def test_multiple_fixtures(database_connection, test_data):
    assert len(test_data) == 5

    # Use the database connection
    assert database_connection.is_connected()
