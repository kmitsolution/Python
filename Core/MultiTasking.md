# MultiTasking in Python
Multitasking in Python refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks simultaneously or concurrently. Python provides various mechanisms for multitasking, enabling developers to write programs that perform multiple tasks concurrently, thereby improving efficiency and responsiveness. Here are some of the common ways to achieve multitasking in Python:

Multithreading in Python allows you to run multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently within a single process. This concurrency enables you to perform multiple tasks simultaneously and can be particularly useful for tasks that involve waiting for I/O operations (e.g., reading/writing to files or making network requests). However, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, multithreading might not fully utilize multiple CPU cores for CPU-bound tasks. For CPU-bound tasks, consider using multiprocessing instead.

In Python, you can achieve multithreading using the threading module, which provides classes and functions to work with threads. Here's a basic example of multithreading in Python:

```python

import threading
import time

# Function to be executed by the thread
def print_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        print(f"Number: {i}")
        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate some work

def print_letters():
    for letter in "ABCDE":
        print(f"Letter: {letter}")
        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate some work

# Create two threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)

# Start the threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Wait for both threads to finish
thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("Both threads have finished.")
```

In this example, we define two functions, print_numbers() and print_letters(), which print numbers and letters respectively. We then create two threads (thread1 and thread2) and assign each function to be executed by its respective thread using the target parameter.

After starting the threads with start(), they run concurrently, executing their respective tasks. The join() method is used to wait for both threads to finish before proceeding with the next part of the code.

Keep in mind that when working with threads, you should be careful about potential race conditions and synchronization issues, especially when multiple threads access shared resources simultaneously. To manage concurrent access to shared resources, consider using synchronization mechanisms like locks or semaphores provided by the threading module.

Again, if you have CPU-bound tasks and want to fully utilize multiple CPU cores, consider using the multiprocessing module for parallel processing instead of the threading module.


## Multiprocessing:
1. Multiprocessing allows you to create multiple processes that run independently and concurrently.
2. Python's multiprocessing module allows you to create and manage processes.
3. Multiprocessing is suitable for tasks that are CPU-bound (such as computations) since it can take advantage of multiple CPU cores.
```python
# importing the multiprocessing module
import multiprocessing
import time

def print_cube(num):
    """
    function to print cube of given num
    """
    print("Cube: {}".format(num * num * num))
    #time.sleep(20)


def print_square(num):
    """
    function to print square of given num
    """
    print("Square: {}".format(num * num))
    #time.sleep(20)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # creating processes
    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_square, args=(10,))
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_cube, args=(10,))

    # starting process 1
    p1.start()
    # starting process 2
    p2.start()

    # wait until process 1 is finished
    p1.join()
    # wait until process 2 is finished
    p2.join()

    # both processes finished
    print("Done!")

```
## Coroutine-based Libraries:
Python has various coroutine-based libraries like aiohttp (for asynchronous HTTP requests), aiomysql (for asynchronous MySQL database access), etc., which allow you to perform asynchronous tasks efficiently.

Multitasking in Python allows you to leverage the system's resources effectively, leading to better performance and responsiveness in certain scenarios. However, it's important to be mindful of potential concurrency issues, such as race conditions or deadlocks, when working with multiple threads or processes. Proper synchronization mechanisms like locks or semaphores should be used when shared resources are accessed by multiple tasks simultaneously.
