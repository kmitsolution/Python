# black module in python
Black is a popular Python code formatter that automatically reformats your Python code to adhere to its strict style guide. It enforces a consistent and opinionated code style, ensuring that your code follows the PEP 8 style guidelines. Black uses a minimalistic approach, striving for simplicity and readability.

To use Black, you need to install it and then run it on your Python code files. Here's how you can use Black to format your Python code:

### Install Black:
You can install Black using pip:

```
pip install black
```

### Running Black:
To format a Python file with Black, simply run the black command followed by the path to the file or directory you want to format:

```
black myfile.py
```

By default, Black will modify the file in place and overwrite the original file with the formatted code. If you want to see the changes without modifying the file, you can use the --diff option:

```
black --diff myfile.py
```

Black will display the changes that would be made without actually writing them to the file.

### Formatting Options:
Black has a few options that you can use to customize its behavior:

1. <b>--line-length:</b> Specifies the maximum line length. The default is 88 characters.
2. <b>--skip-string-normalization:</b> Skips normalizing string quotes to double quotes.
3. <b>--py36:</b> Enables string formatting compatible with Python 3.6.

For example, to set the line length to 100 characters, you can use:

```
black --line-length 100 myfile.py
```
