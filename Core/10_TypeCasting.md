### Type Casting
Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting an object of one data type into another data type. In Python, you can use various built-in functions to perform type casting. Here are some commonly used type casting functions in Python:

#### int(): Converts a value to an integer data type.
```python
x = '5'
y = int(x)
print(y)  # Output: 5
```

#### float(): Converts a value to a floating-point data type.

```python
x = '3.14'
y = float(x)
print(y)  # Output: 3.14
```
#### str(): Converts a value to a string data type.
```python
x = 42
y = str(x)
print(y)  # Output: '42'
```
#### bool(): Converts a value to a Boolean data type.
```python
x = 0
y = bool(x)
print(y)  # Output: False
```
#### list(): Converts an iterable (such as a string, tuple, or set) to a list.
```python
x = 'hello'
y = list(x)
print(y)  # Output: ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```
