Python is a popular <b><u>high-level</u></b> programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. 
It was created by <b><u>Guido van Rossum</u></b> and first released in <b><u>1991</u></b>.
Python emphasizes code readability, with its clean and intuitive syntax, making it easier to learn and understand.
Here are some key features and characteristics of Python:
1.	<b>Easy to Learn:</b> Python has a straightforward and beginner-friendly syntax. Its simplicity allows beginners to write and understand code quickly.
2.	<b>Interpreted Language:</b> Python is an interpreted language, meaning that the code is executed line by line without the need for compilation. This allows for rapid development and prototyping.
3.	<b>Cross-platform Compatibility:</b> Python can run on various operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it highly portable.
4.	<b>Large Standard Library:</b> Python comes with a vast standard library that provides numerous modules and functions for different purposes. These libraries make it easy to perform various tasks without having to write extensive code from scratch.
5.	<b>Third-Party Packages:</b> Python has a rich ecosystem of third-party packages and modules available through the Python Package Index (PyPI). These packages extend the language's capabilities, allowing developers to build complex applications and solve specific problems efficiently.
6.	<b>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</b> Python supports object-oriented programming, allowing you to create and use classes and objects. OOP enables modular and reusable code, making it easier to manage large projects.
7.	<b>Dynamically Typed:</b> Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. The interpreter infers the type based on the value assigned to the variable. This flexibility can speed up development time but may require additional attention to type-related errors.
8.	<b>Versatility:</b> Python is a versatile language used in various domains such as web development, data analysis, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, scripting, and more. It provides numerous frameworks and tools tailored for specific use cases.
