Here’s a detailed breakdown of the steps you mentioned for setting up a Django project, including creating directories for templates, static files, and media files.

### Step 1: Create a New Django Project

To create a new Django project, run the following command in your terminal (with your virtual environment activated):

```bash
django-admin startproject mysite
```

This command will create a new directory called `mysite` with the following structure:

```
mysite/
    manage.py
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py
```

### Step 2: Run the Development Server

Navigate into your project directory:

```bash
cd mysite
```

Then, run the development server with:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You should see output indicating that the server is running, typically at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Open this URL in your web browser to see the Django welcome page.

### Step 3: Create Directories for Templates, Static Files, and Media

It's common to create separate directories for templates, static files, and media files in your Django project. You can do this as follows:

1. **Create Directories**:
   You can create the necessary directories either via the command line or your file explorer. Here’s how to do it via the terminal:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p mysite/templates mysite/static mysite/media
   ```

   This command will create the following structure:

   ```
   mysite/
       manage.py
       mysite/
           __init__.py
           settings.py
           urls.py
           asgi.py
           wsgi.py
       templates/
       static/
       media/
   ```

2. **Configure Settings**:
   Next, you need to tell Django where to find these directories. Open `settings.py` in the `mysite/mysite/` directory and add the following configurations:

   ```python
   import os

   BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

   # Add the following lines
   TEMPLATES = [
       {
           'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
           'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
           ...
       },
   ]

   STATIC_URL = '/static/'
   STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]

   MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
   MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
   ```

### Summary

Now you have successfully created a new Django project, run the development server, and set up directories for templates, static files, and media files. You can start adding your application logic and resources as needed! If you have any further questions or need assistance with specific parts, feel free to ask!
