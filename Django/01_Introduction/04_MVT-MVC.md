Django uses the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, which is a variation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Here’s an overview of both architectures and how they relate to each other:

### MVC Architecture

1. **Model**: Represents the data structure and business logic. It defines the schema of the data and interacts with the database.
   - Responsible for data retrieval, storage, and manipulation.
   - Typically includes classes that correspond to database tables.

2. **View**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the user interface. It retrieves data from the model and passes it to the template for rendering.
   - Contains the logic to handle user input and display data.
   - Responds to user actions and invokes changes in the model or template.

3. **Controller**: Manages user inputs and interactions. It receives input from the user, processes it (often by updating the model), and returns the output display via the view.
   - In traditional MVC, the controller is a separate component that coordinates interactions.

### MVT Architecture in Django

1. **Model**: Similar to MVC, the model in Django defines the data structure and business logic.
   - Uses Django’s ORM to interact with the database.
   - Includes fields, methods, and relationships.

2. **View**: In Django, the view handles the request and returns the response. It retrieves data from the model and processes it, often preparing it for the template.
   - It contains functions or classes that define the behavior of the application in response to user actions.
   - The view decides which template to use for rendering and what data to send.

3. **Template**: This is where MVT diverges from MVC. The template is responsible for rendering the user interface. It defines how data should be presented to the user.
   - Templates are HTML files with embedded Django template language (DTL) to dynamically display data.
   - Focuses solely on the presentation layer, separating it from business logic.

### Summary of Differences

- **Controller**: In traditional MVC, the controller is a distinct entity that manages interactions, while in Django’s MVT, the view takes on that role, managing both request processing and response generation.
- **Template**: In MVT, templates are specifically used for rendering the user interface, emphasizing the separation of presentation from business logic more clearly than in MVC.

### Conclusion

The MVT architecture in Django promotes a clear separation of concerns, allowing developers to maintain a clean and organized codebase. This structure aids in scalability, testability, and maintainability, making it easier to develop complex web applications.
