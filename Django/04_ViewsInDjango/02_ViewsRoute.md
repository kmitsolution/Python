Let's walk through the steps to create a simple Django view and configure the URLs accordingly, based on your provided code.

### Step 1: Create `views.py`

First, create a file called `views.py` in the same folder as your `urls.py` (inside your Django app directory). In `views.py`, write the following code:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def aboutus(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to Kmit Solutions Services")

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("This is your home page")
```

### Step 2: Configure `urls.py`

Next, you need to set up the URL routing in `urls.py`. Open your `urls.py` file (in the same app directory or the project directory depending on your structure) and modify it to include your views. Here’s how it should look:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from . import views  # Make sure to import your views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('about/', views.aboutus, name='about'),  # URL for the about page
    path('home/', views.home, name='home'),        # URL for the home page
]
```

### Step 3: Run the Development Server

Now that you have your views and URLs set up, you can run the Django development server:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory (where `manage.py` is located).
2. Run the server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Step 4: Access Your Views in the Browser

Open your web browser and go to the following URLs:

- For the About Us page:
  ```
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/
  ```

- For the Home page:
  ```
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/home/
  ```

You should see:

- "Welcome to Kmit Solutions Services" when you visit the `/about/` URL.
- "This is your home page" when you visit the `/home/` URL.

### Summary

You’ve successfully created a simple Django application with two views (`aboutus` and `home`), configured the URL routing, and accessed the pages through your browser. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
